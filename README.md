## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this analysis is the 'Bitcoin OTC Trust Weighted Signed Network' obtained from the SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project) datasets. The network represents the who-trusts-whom interactions of individuals trading Bitcoin on the Bitcoin OTC platform. Participants in the network rate each other on a scale of -10 to +10, indicating their level of trust.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:

- Analyze the temporal evolution of trust within the Bitcoin OTC network.
- Identify any significant changes or shifts in the overall trust dynamics over time.
- Explore patterns of trust and identify influential nodes within the network.

## Methodology

The analysis is conducted using various statistical and network analysis techniques, including but not limited to:

- Time series analysis to understand the changes in trust over time.
- Network visualization to identify key nodes and their interactions.
- Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data**: Contains the raw data files used for the analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.
- **images**: Output files, visualizations, and any other relevant results obtained from the analysis.
- **src**: Python scripts, reused in the notebook files.

## Requirements

To run the analysis scripts and notebooks, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## Results

The findings and insights from the analysis are documented in the Jupyter notebooks within the 'notebooks' directory. Visualizations and summary statistics are provided to illustrate the trends and changes in trust dynamics over time.
